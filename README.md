# SnakesOnWheelsCarInsurance Project Details

Welcome Everyone! This project is a fully functional IOS application that was developed in a group consisting of my two friends and I. This application was for a college graduate final project and was presented in front of professors and the head of computer science at my college (NYIT).

The Snakes on Wheels Car Insurance Application was developed using the Swift programming language in the xCode IDE, UIKit/PDFKit package in xCode, and Firebase (the backend database)

We followed the Rapid-Application-Development (RAD) with the combination of Scrum when working on this project.

All sensitive information is encrypted in the database for security purposes.

The Snakes on Wheels Car Insurance application will serve the sole purpose of generating insurance policy quotes for customers. Customers will be required to create an account or login and complete an insurance policy form. Once the form is completed, the system will send the completed policy to the customer so it can be looked over. If the customer decides to accept the policy offer, they are asked to submit a payment for the policy. Once payment is received, the system will send the customer both the insurance policy and the state-required coverage statement. If the customer declines the offer, the customer will be brought back to the dashboard of the system. The system will then send a notice every few months displaying the policy coverage changes and request a payment from the customer to receive the updated statements/documents.

Advantages of our System:

The design of this system has a lot of advantages. The system is designed for the user to be able to do everything in order to acquire auto insurance, straight from the app. The user will be able to provide all of their information, get a quote, get a copy of that quote sent to them, pick which policy best suits their needs, and pay for the policy, all with the touch of a button. The user will not have to worry about needing to switch devices to input all of their information and providing their own DMV records. This system will allow anyone to get auto insurance easily through a user friendly app. 


Two types of accounts for this application: Users and Admins

Admins can:
  - Can change the questions on the insurance form
  - Ability to edit the insurance form draft with user's information before and after its submitted
  - Ability to edit any policy information in policies
  - Ability to update or edit user's payment information
 
 Users can:
  - View and fill out insurance form questions
  - Ability to edit the insurance form draft with user's information before its submitted
  - Can only view the finalized insurance form after its submitted
  - Can view policies
  - Can edit payment information

Thank you for reading about this project!
Have a wonderful day.
